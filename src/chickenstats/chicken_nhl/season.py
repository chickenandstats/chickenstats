    Convenience wrapper around instantiating a ``Season`` per year and calling

    Parameters:
        years (list[str | int | float] | range):
            One year identifier per season to scrape, in any format accepted by
            ``Season.__init__`` (4-digit or 8-digit), e.g., ``[2021, 2022, 2023]``
            or ``range(2021, 2024)``.
        teams (list[str] | str | None):
            Three-letter team's schedule to scrape, e.g., NSH. Applied to every season.
        sessions (list[str] | str | None):
            Whether to scrape regular season ("R"), playoffs ("P"), pre-season ("PR"),
            or 4 Nations Face Off ("FO"). If left blank, scrapes regular season and playoffs.
        backend (Backend | Literal["polars", "pandas", "pyarrow", "narwhals"]):

        disable_progress_bar (bool):

    """Add rest-day and back-to-back context for each team in a schedule.

    Returns a long-format DataFrame keyed on ``(game_id, team)`` — one row per team per
    game, twice as many rows as the input schedule — rather than adding `home_*`/`away_*`
    -suffixed columns to the wide schedule shape. Join it back onto `game_id`/`team` (or
    `game_id`/`home_team`/`away_team`) to attach context to play-by-play or stats output.

    Rest days are the number of calendar days since that team's previous game found
    anywhere in ``schedule``, so a team's first game in the input has null rest days (no
    earlier game to diff against) — if ``schedule`` spans multiple seasons (e.g.
    ``multi_season_schedule()`` output), a season opener's rest days reflect the (large)
    gap since the prior season's last game rather than being null.

    Strength-of-schedule (e.g. opponent quality) is out of scope here — it needs a
    "team strength" metric that isn't buildable from schedule data alone.

    Parameters:
        schedule (DataFrameT): Schedule DataFrame from ``Season.schedule()`` or
            ``multi_season_schedule()`` (or any DataFrame with ``game_id``, ``game_date``,
