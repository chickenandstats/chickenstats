"""Player identity and career statistics: the Player utility class.

Wraps the NHL API's public player endpoints, providing structured access to
career totals, season-by-season splits, game logs, and featured stats. All
data-fetching properties are prefixed with ``_`` and trigger a network call
on first access; identity properties (``player_name``, ``current_team``, etc.)
are cheap dict lookups into the pre-fetched landing page payload.

Public class:
    Player: Resolves a player ID to identity metadata and on-demand career stats.

class Player:
    """NHL player identity and career statistics.

    Wraps the NHL API's public player endpoints. Pass a numeric player ID (the
    same ``api_id`` returned by ``Scraper.rosters``) to get structured access to
    career totals, season logs, and featured stats.

    Parameters:
        player_id (int | str): The NHL API player ID (e.g. ``8478402`` for Connor McDavid).
        backend (str): Output backend for any DataFrame-returning methods.
            One of ``"polars"`` or ``"pandas"``. Default ``"polars"``.

    Attributes:
        player_id (int | str): Stored player ID.
        player_name (str): Full player name (first + last).
        first_name (str): First name.
        last_name (str): Last name.
        is_active (bool): Whether the player is currently on an NHL roster.
        current_team (str): Three-letter abbreviation of the player's current team.
        current_team_id (int): NHL API team ID for the player's current team.
        current_team_name (str): Common team name (e.g. ``"Predators"``).
        current_team_full_name (str): Full English team name (e.g. ``"Nashville Predators"``).
        current_team_full_name_fr (str): Full French name of the player's current team.
        active_seasons (list): Regular-season season IDs the player has appeared in.
        playoff_seasons (list): Playoff season IDs the player has appeared in.

    Note:
        Properties prefixed with ``_`` (e.g. ``_career_totals``, ``_game_logs``) trigger
        a network call on first access. Plain identity attributes above are cheap dict
        lookups into the landing page response fetched lazily via ``_landing_info``.
        Call ``prefetch()`` to warm both network caches concurrently before accessing
        multiple properties.

    Examples:
        >>> from chickenstats.chicken_nhl import Player
        >>> mcd = Player(8478402)
        >>> mcd.player_name
        'Connor McDavid'
        >>> mcd.current_team
        'EDM'
        >>> mcd._career_totals  # triggers network call
