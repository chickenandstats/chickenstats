    Note:
        You can return any of the properties as a Pandas DataFrame by appending '_df' to the property

    Examples:
        First, instantiate the Game object
        >>> game = Game(2023020001)

        Scrape play-by-play information
        >>> pbp = game.play_by_play  # Returns the data as a list

        Get play-by-play as a Pandas DataFrame
        >>> pbp_df = game.play_by_play_df  # Returns the data as a Pandas DataFrame

        The object stores information from each component of the play-by-play data
        >>> shifts = game.shifts  # Returns a list of shifts
        >>> rosters = game.rosters  # Returns a list of players from both API & HTML endpoints
        >>> changes = game.changes  # Returns a list of changes constructed from shifts & roster data

        Data can also be returned as a Pandas DataFrame, rather than a list
        >>> shifts_df = game.shifts_df  # Same as above, but as Pandas DataFrame

        Access data from API or HTML endpoints, or both
        >>> api_events = game.api_events
        >>> api_rosters = game.api_rosters
        >>> html_events = game.html_events
        >>> html_rosters = game.html_rosters

        The Game object is fairly rich with information
        >>> game_date = game.game_date
        >>> home_team = game.home_team
        >>> game_state = game.game_state
        >>> seconds_remaining = game.seconds_remaining
