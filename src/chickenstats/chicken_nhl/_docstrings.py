"""Shared docstring constants and utilities.

Organized in three layers:

1. **``shared_doc`` decorator** — stamps a pre-built string onto any callable
   or ``property`` object so both IDEs and mkdocstrings pick it up.

2. **Field registries** — plain dicts mapping ``field_name -> (type_str, description)``.
   Each field is defined once here and referenced by every docstring that uses it.

3. **Docstring constants** — f-strings that compose a preamble, a
   ``_build_returns()`` call, and a per-caller Examples section.

To add a new field: add one entry to the relevant registry dict.
To update a description: change one entry — all consumers update automatically.
To add a new docstring: write an f-string that calls ``_build_returns()``.
