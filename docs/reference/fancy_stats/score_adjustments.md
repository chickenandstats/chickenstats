# :material-adjust: **Score and venue adjustments**

One of the more interesting parts about hockey is that the losing team gets the puck more frequently - a
team with a lead plays more defensively, while teams who are trailing will press more offensively, generating
an outsize number of changes.[^1] The dynamic differs whether the team is at home or on the road, with the home team
generating chances at a higher rate whether leading or trailing.[^2] [^3] The methodology for the
score and venue adjustments included with `chickenstats` is employed by both 
[*Evolving-Hockey*](https://evolving-hockey.com/glossary/score-adjustments/)
and [*HockeyViz*](https://www.hockeyviz.com/txt/senstats), which is itself an improvement on an earlier methodology 
proposed by Eric Tulsky, who is now the GM of the Carolina Hurricanes.

    See, e.g., [*Evolving-Hockey*](https://evolving-hockey.com/glossary/general-terms/) (glossary on score / venue effects
    / adjustments), [*Hockey Viz*](https://www.hockeyviz.com/txt/senstats) (more on Micah's methodology below),
    [*Yahoo Sports*](https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/fancy-stats-164244781.html). It's possible
    that the chances generated by the losing team, although higher volume, are of generally lower quality,
    but that requires further research

    Again, see, e.g., [*Evolving-Hockey*](https://evolving-hockey.com/glossary/general-terms/) (glossary on score / venue effects
    / adjustments), [*HockeyViz*](https://www.hockeyviz.com/txt/senstats) (more on Micah's methodology below),

    I vividly remember the twins at EH writing that teams' scorekeepers generally overstate scoring chance 
    quality when at home (i.e., chart the puck closer to the net, on average), however I can't find this on the site
    anywhere. It would be very tempting to recreate the research...
