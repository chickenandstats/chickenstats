# :fontawesome-solid-user-group: **Contribute**

I appreciate any and all input or support. Feel free to contribute with bug reports or feature requests at
the **[GitHub issues page](https://github.com/chickenandstats/chickenstats/issues)**.
For anything longer term, I've set out my development plans at the
**[:octicons-project-roadmap-24: Roadmap](roadmap.md)**. 

`chickenstats` is designed to be as modular and user-friendly as possible. 
The **[:material-ruler-square: Design](backend/design.md)** page outlines how the different
pieces fit together, as well as the basic rules for accessing raw data.

You can also find reference materials for **[non-public class methods](backend/chicken_nhl.md)**
available from objects in `chickenstats.chicken_nhl.scrape`.
**[Nested functions for munging raw data](backend/evolving_hockey.md)** from
**[evolving-hockey.com](https://www.evolving-hockey.com)** can be found within `chickenstats.evolving_hockey.base`
and `chickenstats.evolving_hockey.stats`.

For contributing to the xG model, or for questions about the underlying research & data,
please see **[:material-google-analytics: xG Model](../xg_model/xg_model.md)**.
