# :material-food-drumstick: **`chickenstats`**

Welcome to the technical documentation & reference materials for **[chickenstats](https://github.com/chickenandstats/chickenstats)**,
an open-source Python package for scraping & analyzing sports data.

![Hero image of a scatter plot with drumsticks inter-mixed](assets/site_images/hero_transparent.png)

With just a few lines of code:

* **Scrape & manipulate** data from various NHL endpoints, leveraging
[:material-hockey-sticks: chicken_nhl](reference/chicken_nhl/scrape.md), which includes
an **open-source xG model** for shot quality metrics
* **Augment play-by-play data** & **generate custom aggregations** from raw csv files downloaded from
[Evolving-Hockey](https://evolving-hockey.com) *(subscription required)* with
[:material-hockey-puck: evolving_hockey](reference/evolving_hockey/stats.md)

Here you can find detailed guides & explanations for most features. The package is under active development - download
the latest version (1.8.0) for the most up-to-date features & be sure to consult the correct documentation
:fontawesome-solid-face-smile-beam:.

## :material-download: **Installation**

`chickenstats` requires Python 3.10 or greater & runs on the latest stable versions of Linux, macOS, & Windows
operating systems.(1) You can install it through PyPi:
{ .annotate }
    
1. Best practice is to develop in an isolated virtual environment (conda or otherwise), but who's a chicken to judge?

```shell
pip install chickenstats
```

## :keyboard: **Usage**

`chickenstats` is structured as two underlying modules, each used with different data sources: `chickenstats.chicken_nhl`
and `chickenstats.evolving_hockey`.(1)
{ .annotate }
    
1. The package is under active development - features will be added or modified over time, but this structure will be
consistent 

=== ":material-hockey-sticks: **chicken_nhl**"

    :material-hockey-sticks: **chicken_nhl**

    `chickenstats.chicken_nhl` allows you to scrape play-by-play data and aggregate individual, line, and team statistics,
    with an open-source xG model included out-of-the-box.
    
    After importing the module, scrape the schedule for game IDs, then play-by-play data for your team of choice:

    ```python
    from chickenstats.chicken_nhl import Season, Scraper
    
    season = Season(2024)
    
    schedule = season.schedule("NSH") # (1)!
    game_ids = schedule.loc[schedule.game_state == "OFF"].game_id.tolist() # (2)!
    
    scraper = Scraper(game_ids)
    
    play_by_play = scraper.play_by_play # (3)!
    ```

    1. Replace Nashville with the three-letter code of the team of your choice. Leaving it blank will scrape everyone's
    schedule for that year
    2. Other game states include LIVE and FUT
    3. Scrapes one game every three seconds

    ??? info

        If you have already scraped or aggregated data, you'll notice slightly different behaviors than the simple
        guide below. `chickenstats.chicken_nhl` stores all data already scraped or aggregated, so it can be quickly provided
        when the relevant attribute is called (e.g., if you have already called `Scraper.play_by_play` and you have
        not added any new game IDs to the Scraper object,
        calling `Scraper.play_by_play` will return the dataframe, without having to re-scrape the data). 

        You can reset attributes with a matching `prep_` method (e.g., `Scraper.stats` can be reset
        with `Scraper.prep_stats()`). See [:material-ruler-square: Design](./contribute/backend/design.md)
        for more on this dynamic

    You can then aggregate the play-by-play data for individual and on-ice statistics with one line of code:

    ```python
    stats = scraper.stats # (1)!
    ```
    
    1. This runs `scraper.prep_stats()` behind the scenes, if you have not already done so.
    By default aggregates to stats game level, but
    does not include teammates, opposition, or score state in the aggregation fields.

    It's very easy to introduce additional detail to the aggregations, including for teammates on-ice:
    
    ```python
    scraper.prep_stats(teammates=True) # (1)!
    stats = scraper.stats
    ```

    1. The Scraper object saves the prior aggregation to the `scraper.stats` attribute, so it needs to be reset.
    Then the attribute can be re-called

    There is similar functionality for line and team stats:

    ```python
    scraper.prep_lines(position="f") # (1)!
    forward_lines = scraper.lines

    team_stats = scraper.team_stats # (2)!
    ```

    1. This step isn't strictly necessary for forwards - they're the default line aggregation. Provide "d" instead of "f"
    for defensive line stats
    2. Similar to `scraper.stats`, runs `scraper.prep_team_stats()` in the background

    For additional information on usage and functionality, consult the relevant
    [:material-school: User guide](./guide/chicken_nhl/chicken_nhl.md)

=== ":material-hockey-puck: **evolving_hockey**"
 
    :material-hockey-puck: **evolving_hockey**

    The `chickenstats.evolving_hockey` module manipulates raw csv files downloaded from
    [Evolving-Hockey](https://evolving-hockey.com).(1) Using their original shifts & play-by-play
    data, users can add additional
    information & aggregate for individual & on-ice statistics,
    including high-danger shooting events, xG & adjusted xG, faceoffs, & changes.
    { .annotate }
    
    1. An Evolving-Hockey subscription is required to make full use of the `chickenstats.evolving_hockey` module.
        If you don't have a subscription, you can sign up for one [here](https://evolving-hockey.com/login/)

    First, prep a play-by-play dataframe using the raw play-by-play and shifts CSV files:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from chickenstats.evolving_hockey import prep_pbp, prep_stats, prep_lines
    
    raw_shifts = pd.read_csv('./raw_shifts.csv') # (1)!
    raw_pbp = pd.read_csv('./raw_pbp.csv') # (2)!
    
    play_by_play = prep_pbp(raw_pbp, raw_shifts) # (3)!
    ```

    1. Download raw shifts data from [here](https://evolving-hockey.com/stats/shift_query/)
    2. Download raw play-by-play data from [here](https://evolving-hockey.com/stats/pbp_query/)
    3. This returns a dataframe with a bunch more columns, essentially

    You can use the play_by_play dataframe in various aggregations. This will return individual game statistics,
    including on-ice (e.g., GF, xGF) & usage (i.e., zone starts), accounting for teammates & opposition on-ice:
    
    ```python
    individual_game = prep_stats(play_by_play, level='game', teammates=True, opposition=True)
    ```
    
    This will return game statistics for forward-line combinations, accounting for opponents on-ice:
    
    ```python
    forward_lines = prep_lines(play_by_play, level='game', position='f', opposition=True)
    ```
    
    For additional information on usage and functionality, consult the relevant
    [:material-school: User guide](./guide/evolving_hockey/evolving_hockey.md)

## :material-heart: **Acknowledgements**

`chickenstats` wouldn't be possible without the support & efforts of countless others. I am obviously
extremely grateful, even if there are too many of you to thank individually. However, this chicken will do his best.

First & foremost is my wife - the lovely Mrs. Chicken has been patient, understanding, & supportive throughout the countless
hours of development, sometimes to her detriment.

Sincere apologies to the friends & family that have put up with me since my entry into Python, programming, & data
analysis in January 2021. Thank you for being excited for me & with me throughout all of this, especially when you've
had to fake it...

Thank you to the hockey analytics community on (the artist formerly known as) Twitter. You're producing
& reacting to cutting-edge statistical analyses, while providing a supportive, welcoming environment for newcomers.
Thank y'all for everything that you do. This is by no means exhaustive, but there are a few people worth
calling out specifically:

* Josh & Luke Younggren ([@EvolvingWild](https://twitter.com/EvolvingWild))
* Bryan Bastin ([@BryanBastin](https://twitter.com/BryanBastin))
* Max Tixador ([@woumaxx](https://twitter.com/woumaxx))
* Micah Blake McCurdy ([@IneffectiveMath](https://twitter.com/IneffectiveMath))
* Prashanth Iyer ([@iyer_prashanth](https://twitter.com/iyer_prashanth))
* The Bucketless ([@the_bucketless](https://twitter.com/the_bucketless))
* Shayna Goldman ([@hayyyshayyy](https://twitter.com/hayyyshayyy))
* Dom Luszczyszyn ([@domluszczyszyn](https://twitter.com/domluszczyszyn))

I'm also grateful to the thriving community of Python educators & open-source contributors on Twitter. Thank y'all
for your knowledge & practical advice. Matt Harrison ([@__mharrison__](https://twitter.com/__mharrison__))
deserves a special mention for his books on Pandas and XGBoost, both of which are available at his online
[store](https://store.metasnake.com). Again, not exhaustive, but others worth thanking individually:

* Will McGugan ([@willmcgugan](https://twitter.com/willmcgugan))
* Rodrigo Girão Serrão ([@mathsppblog](https://twitter.com/mathsppblog))
* Mike Driscoll ([@driscollis](https://twitter.com/driscollis))
* Trey Hunner ([@treyhunner](https://twitter.com/treyhunner))
* Pawel Jastrzebski ([@pawjast](https://twitter.com/pawjast))

Finally, this library depends on a host of other open-source packages. `chickenstats` is possible because of the efforts
of thousands of individuals, represented below:
