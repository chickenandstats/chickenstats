I am obviously extremely grateful, even if there are too many of you to thank individually. However, this chicken will do his best.</p> <p>First &amp; foremost is my wife - the lovely Mrs. Chicken has been patient, understanding, &amp; supportive throughout the countless hours of development, sometimes to her detriment.</p> <p>Sincere apologies to the friends &amp; family that have put up with me since my entry into Python, programming, &amp; data analysis in January 2021. Thank you for being excited for me &amp; with me throughout all of this, especially when you've had to fake it...</p> <p>Thank you to the hockey analytics community on (the artist formerly known as) Twitter. You're producing &amp; reacting to cutting-edge statistical analyses, while providing a supportive, welcoming environment for newcomers. Thank y'all for everything that you do. This is by no means exhaustive, but there are a few people worth calling out specifically:</p> <ul> <li>Josh &amp; Luke Younggren (@EvolvingWild)</li> <li>Bryan Bastin (@BryanBastin)</li> <li>Max Tixador (@woumaxx)</li> <li>Micah Blake McCurdy (@IneffectiveMath)</li> <li>Prashanth Iyer (@iyer_prashanth)</li> <li>The Bucketless (@the_bucketless)</li> <li>Shayna Goldman (@hayyyshayyy)</li> <li>Dom Luszczyszyn (@domluszczyszyn)</li> </ul> <p>I'm also grateful to the thriving community of Python educators &amp; open-source contributors on Twitter. Thank y'all for your knowledge &amp; practical advice. Matt Harrison (@mharrison) deserves a special mention for his books on Pandas and XGBoost, both of which are available at his online store.
