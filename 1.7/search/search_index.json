See  Design for more on this dynamic</p> <p>You can then aggregate the play-by-play data for individual and on-ice statistics with one line of code:</p> <pre><code>stats = scraper.stats # (1)!\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>This runs <code>scraper.prep_stats()</code> behind the scenes, if you have not already done so. By default aggregates to game level statistics, but does not include teammates, opposition, or score state in the aggregation fields.</li> </ol> <p>It's very easy to introduce additional detail to, as well as change the level of, aggregations,  including for season-level statistics accounting for teammates on-ice:</p> <pre><code>scraper.prep_stats(level=\"season\", teammates=True) # (1)!\nstats = scraper.stats\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>The Scraper object saves the prior aggregation to the <code>scraper.stats</code> attribute, so it needs to be reset. Then the attribute can be re-called, with a different level of aggregation, i.e., season and including  teammates on-ice</li> </ol> <p>There is similar functionality for forward line / defensive pairing stats:</p> <pre><code>scraper.prep_lines(position=\"f\") # (1)!\nforward_lines = scraper.lines\n\nscraper.prep_lines(position=\"d\", level=\"season\") # (2)!\ndefense_lines = scraper.lines\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>This step isn't strictly necessary for forwards - they're the default line aggregation. Provide \"d\" instead of \"f\" for defensive line stats</li> <li>Reset the aggregation settings to get season-level defensive pairing stats</li> </ol> <p>As well as for team stats:</p> <pre><code>team_stats = scraper.team_stats # (1)!\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Similar to <code>scraper.stats</code>, runs <code>scraper.prep_team_stats()</code> in the background</li> </ol> <p>For additional information on usage and functionality, consult the relevant  User guide</p> <p> evolving_hockey</p> <p>The <code>chickenstats.evolving_hockey</code> module manipulates raw csv files downloaded from Evolving-Hockey.(1) Using their original shifts &amp; play-by-play data, users can add additional information &amp; aggregate for individual &amp; on-ice statistics, including high-danger shooting events, xG &amp; adjusted xG, faceoffs, &amp; changes.</p> <ol> <li>An Evolving-Hockey subscription is required to make full use of the <code>chickenstats.evolving_hockey</code> module.

to scrape data from official NHL sources(1) &amp; construct a play-by-play dataframe with 70+ potential fields(2) for each event.(3) Each game is scraped in approximately 3-4 seconds, with minimal performance degradation after scraping hundreds or thousands of games.(4) All underlying data is stored after retrieval and processing.(5)</p> <ol> <li>Sources include (non-exhaustive):  HTML shifts,  events, &amp;  rosters, as well as  events,  rosters, &amp;  game information from the NHL's API endpoints.</li> <li>Fields include (non-exhaustive) primary player idenfitication &amp; information (e.g., position), various game state characteristics (e.g., strength-state, score-state, score differential), Cartesian event coordinates, shot type (e.g., wrist, slap, deflection), distance &amp; angle from net,  &amp; on-ice teammate &amp; opponent identification &amp; information.</li> <li>Supported events include:  goals (including assists),  shots on net,  missed shots,  blocked shots,  faceoffs,  penalties &amp; delayed penalties,  giveaways, &amp;  takeaways.</li> <li>This can be improved (and will be as the library is refactored). However, the library was designed with known negative impacts (e.g., Pydantic-based data validation).</li> <li>For example, HTML &amp; API events data, key inputs for the play-by-play DataFrame, are retained after scraping play-by-play data. This reduces the burden on public endpoints &amp; improves debugging.</li> </ol> Data are supported from 2010-11 to present <p>With some exceptions for individual games, the <code>Game</code> &amp; <code>Scraper</code> objects  will return data for games occurring since the start of the 2010-2011 season. However, the <code>Season</code> object (including the <code>schedule()</code> &amp; <code>standings()</code> methods) will return data extending to the NHL's founding in 1917.</p> <p>The module includes three classes for accessing data. First, import the relevant classes:</p> <pre><code>from chickenstats.chicken_nhl import Scraper, Season, Game\n</code></pre> <code>Scraper</code><code>Game</code><code>Season</code> <p>Scrapes individual &amp; multiple games. It takes a single game ID or a list-like object of game IDs &amp; scrapes publicly-accessible, official NHL endpoints and returns a Pandas DataFrame.</p> <p>Data include (non-exhaustive):  HTML shifts,  events, &amp;  rosters, as well as  events,  rosters, &amp;  game information from the NHL's API endpoints.</p> Example <p>Scrape play-by-play data for the first ten games of the 2023-24 regular season</p> <pre><code>game_ids = list(range(2023020001, 2023020011))\nscraper = Scraper(game_ids)\npbp = scraper.play_by_play\n</code></pre> <p>Scrape roster data for the first ten games of the 2023-24 regular season</p> <pre><code>game_ids = list(range(2023020001, 2023020011))\nscraper = Scraper(game_ids)\nrosters = scraper.rosters\n</code></pre> <p>The module is designed to minimize repeatedly scraping or aggregating data that has already been scraped or aggregated. If you've already called the <code>scraper.play_by_play</code> attribute, the <code>Scraper</code> object won't  re-scrape the data, unless you've added new game IDs.</p> Example <p>This will scrape data the first time called</p> <pre><code>game_ids = list(range(2023020001, 2023020011))\nscraper = Scraper(game_ids)\npbp = scraper.play_by_play\n</code></pre> <p>Subsequent calls allow you to re-access the data without re-scraping</p> <pre><code>scraper.play_by_play\n</code></pre> <p>If you add new game IDs to the <code>Scraper</code> object, then the new data are re-scraped</p> <pre><code>new_ids = list(range(2023020012, 2023020015))\nscraper.add_games(new_ids)\n\npbp = scraper.play_by_play\n</code></pre> <p>The same dynamic is true for aggregating individual, line and team statistics. Once an aggregation has been completed, subsequent calls to the attribute will return the data without having to re-run calculations. The saved data can be reset with relevant <code>prep_</code> method.</p> Example <p>First scrape some play-by-play data</p> <pre><code>game_ids = list(range(2023020001, 2023020011))\nscraper = Scraper(game_ids)\npbp = scraper.play_by_play\n</code></pre> <p>You can access individual stats with the default aggregations with the <code>scraper.stats</code> property</p> <pre><code>stats = scraper.stats\n</code></pre> <p>If you don't want to change the aggregation, you can re-call the stats using the <code>scraper.stats</code> property.  If you want to change the aggregation, you can reset the data</p> <pre><code>scraper.prep_stats(teammates=True)\nstats = scraper.stats\n</code></pre> <p>Functionality is similar for line and team statistics. If you want to access a different level of aggregation, you can reset the saved data</p> <pre><code>scraper.prep_lines(position=\"f\") # (1)!\nforwards = scraper.lines\n\nscraper.prep_lines(position=\"d\") # (2)!\ndefense = scraper.lines\n\nteam_stats = scraper.team_stats # (3)!\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>This is isn't technically necessary, as the forwards are the defaults for line aggregations</li> <li>Specificy \"d\" for the position parameter to reset the data to defensive lines</li> <li>No need to prep team stats data, you can access the defaults through the property</li> </ol> <p>Scrapes data for a single game. A series of <code>Game</code> objects functions as the backbone of any <code>Scraper</code> object - the data &amp; fields returned are identical. Because of this, I'd recommend sticking with the <code>Scraper</code>, unless you're planning to contribute to the library.</p> Example <p>The <code>Game</code> object functions similarly to the <code>Scraper</code> object, with the major exception that data are returned as a list by default.</p> <p>To return a list of play-by-play events</p> <pre><code>game_id = 2023020001\ngame = Game(game_id)\npbp = game.play_by_play\n</code></pre> <p>To return the equivalent Pandas DataFrame, simply append \"_df\" to the property</p> <pre><code>game_id = 2023020001\ngame = Game(game_id)\npbp = game.play_by_play_df\n</code></pre> <p>If you'd like to contribute, most bugs are addressed &amp; most new features added will be at the <code>Game</code>, rather than the <code>Scraper</code> level.</p> <p>Prototypical usage for the <code>Game</code> object is debugging. There are various non-public methods to access data at intermediate processing stages. The below returns a list of raw HTML events, prior to any processing. For more information &amp; direction, see  Contribute</p> Example <p>Data are stored and processed with non-public methods with <code>Game</code> object. They generally follow the same few steps, illustrated with the html events flow below</p> <pre><code>from chickenstats.chicken_nhl import Game\n\ngame_id = 2023020001\ngame = Game(game_id)\ngame._scrape_html_events() # (1)!\ngame._munge_html_events() # (2)!\n\nhtml_events = game._html_events # (3)!\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Scrapes the data initially. Stores raw data using <code>game._html_events</code> attribute</li> <li>Cleans the data after scraping. Can access the now cleaned data from <code>game._html_events</code> attribute</li> <li>This is functionally the same as game.html_events</li> </ol> <p>Scrapes schedule and standings information for a given season. The standings returned are for that exact moment in time - I don't know of a way to access historical information.</p> Example <p>Scrape schedule data for every team for the current (2023-24) season</p> <pre><code>season = Season(2023)\nschedule = season.schedule()\n</code></pre> <p>For a specific team, just provide the three-letter abbreviation</p> <pre><code>season = Season(2023)\nschedule = season.schedule('NSH')\n</code></pre> <p>To get the latest standings for that season</p> <pre><code>season = Season(2023)\nstandings = season.standings\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"contribute/backend/design/#evolving_hockey","title":"<code>evolving_hockey</code>","text":"<p><code>chickenstats.evolving_hockey</code> provides tools to munge data from official Evolving-Hockey sources.(1) The module's functions combine raw play-by-play and shift csv files available from the queries section of the site, then  aggregate the data.(2) The resulting aggregations have additional fields(3) that are not currently available.</p> <ol> <li>Subscription (and I cannot emphasize this enough) required.</li> <li>Aggregations include line and team level, as well as groupings by score state, teammates, and opposition.</li> <li>Additional fields include:  high-danger events,  score- and venue-adjusted events, using evolving-hockey's methodology and figures  forwards and defensemen on-ice.</li> </ol> <p>The module includes four functions for accessing data.
